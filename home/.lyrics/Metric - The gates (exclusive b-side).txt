Tears me up to be stuck at the gates
How you stay in one place like molasses
All you want
All you want
Is somebody to get off on

Alibi with the man that you offer
All the ways it's untrue, I won't fight 
All you're not
All you're not
All dishonest in your heart 

Lullaby and they play it on the guitar 
Fire you up to get out and get some 
All this is 
All this is 
But the bottle did get dropped out

All you want 
All you want 
Is someone to get off on
