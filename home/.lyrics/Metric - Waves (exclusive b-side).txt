Saw the water, not the waves
Caught your eye, forgot your name
Always leaving, either way
I want you to stop me

Episodes to fantasize
TV movie of our lives
The future is all mine
I'll find it on my way back

When I'm gone
I'll know what I've done
I'll go where I don't belong

It's all, not one
I love everything
No sleep; I lose everything
Oh don't tell me again
I won't see you again

Not one
I love everything
No sleep; I lose everything
Oh, don't tell me again
I won't see you again

Saw the waves, but not the tide
I couldn't stay, I don't know why
A sailor married to the sea
My luck is a lost key

The door is locked from the inside
Don't wait around, I won't arrive
Keep a room somewhere for me
I'll find it on my way back

When I'm gone
I'll know what I've done
I'll go where I don't belong

It's all, not one
I love everything
No sleep; I lose everything
Oh don't tell me again
I won't see you again

Not one
I love everything
No sleep; I lose everything
Oh, don't tell me again
I won't see you again
