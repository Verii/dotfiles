Grow up and blow away

Flooding the room two by two
From the womb to the holiday
There is no holiday

First double-cross her heart
He wants to start a family
Needing something to go on

If she weren't writing in blood
She'd bring him her jokes, a new liver
And a shovel for the mud

If he were not knee-deep in mud
He'd bring her his drugs
He'd get her a typewriter

If this is the life
Why does it feel so good to die today?
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away

If this is the life 
Why does it feel so good to die today?
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away

Nobody knows which street to take
He took the easy way
What was the easy way?

First double-cross her heart
He wants to start a family
She always thought she would not

If she weren't writing in blood
She'd bring him her jokes, a new liver
And a shovel for the mud

If he were not knee-deep in mud
He'd bring her his drugs
He'd get her a typewriter

If this is the life
Why does it feel so good to die today?
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away

If this is the life 
Why does it feel so good to die today?
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away

First double-cross her heart
He wants to start a family
Her body is the baby

If this is the life
Why does it feel so good to die today?
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away

If this is the life
Why does it feel so good to die today?
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away

Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away

Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away
Blue to gray
Grow up and blow away
