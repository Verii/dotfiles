Wipe it up, you're capable 
Of putting back a few when you have to
Rememorize the history of your body
Like a virgin
Ladies' night
80's night
The kids get high and eat TV
So do we
For Halloween
I want to be Lenny Bruce

I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
So you can love me on the sly

My old flame broke the 12 bar blues
Just to prove he could
He pays the airline DJs now
He is everywhere

I want him to hate me
I want him to hate me
I want him to hate me
I want him to hate me
I want him to hate me
So you can love me on the sly.
I want him to hate me
I want him to hate me
I want him to hate me

I don't feel so far away from you lately
love me on the sly

Fill me in on horrible
How much is there
where else can I live?
The dirty sugar factory
On the water
(On the water)
Should smell sweet

I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately
love me on the sly

I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately
love me on the sly

I want them to hate me
I want them to hate me
I don't feel so far away from you lately
love me on the sly
