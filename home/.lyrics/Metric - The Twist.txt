We were too wasted to close the window
Friends and family looking in
To my only hiding place
The rhythm of a stranger's skin

Infidel to die for
what I'm doing
will happen in the morning
when the mirror won't recognise me

He hold a certain gesture
When we're loving to ask each other
Do you want it? Do you want me?
I want it
It is you
You are where I want to be

Who is he? (oh)
Why would I (do)
Hitch a ride? (the)
I can drive. (twist)
Who is she? (oh)
Why would I (do)
Hitch a ride (the)
When I can drive? (twist)

Somebody put me back in school
I forget everything I used to know
How to leave the boy behind
Without having to watch him go

Oh, infidel to die for
what I'm doing
will happen in the morning
when the mirror won't recognise me

He holds a certain gesture
When we're loving to ask each other
Do you want it? Do you want me?
I want it
It is you
You are where I want to be

Who is he? (Circumstantial)
Why would I (do)
Hitch a ride? (the)
I can drive (twist)
Who is she? (Circumstantial)
Why would I (do)
Hitch a ride (the)
When I can drive? (twist)

Circumstantial
Do the twist (repeat till fade)
