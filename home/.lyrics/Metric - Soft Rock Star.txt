Climbed the wall to make the sun rise in time
But the night had already begun
Climbed the wall to make the sun rise in time
But the night had already begun
Now here I am, I am the one

So hang high, soft star
Don't shine before swine

Not a lot of room to move
Ah, so where's my guide?
I tried looking up to you girls
Please correct me, but didn't you let the work slide?
Capitalize on a novelty, cheap pink spotlight

"Choose the highest bidder" was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls
But failed until now

Bubblegum ball martini
Is nothing like dépanneur red wine
Travel through time
Who were you after?
You were mine

"Choose the highest bidder" was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls
But failed until now

So hang high
Soft rock star
Hang high
Soft rock star
Don't shine before swine

"Choose the highest bidder" was my answer
When they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls, haven't they?

"Choose the highest bidder" was my answer
when they told me I was up for sale
Schoolyard, junior high style
Bullies have always tried to buy the better girls
But failed until now

So hang high
