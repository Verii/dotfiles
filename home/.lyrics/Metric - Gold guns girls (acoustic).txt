All the gold and the guns in the world
Couldn't get you off
All the gold and the guns and the girls
Couldn't get you off
All the boys, all the choices in the world

I remember when we were gambling to win
Everybody else said better luck next time
I don't wanna bend. Let the bad girls bend
I just wanna be your friend
Is it ever gonna be enough?

Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?

All the lace and the skin in the shop
Couldn't get you off
All the toys and the tools in the box
Couldn't get you off
All the noise, all the voices never stop

I remember when we were gambling to win
Everybody else said better luck next time
I don't wanna bend. Let the bad girls bend
I just wanna be your friend
Why you giving me a hard time?
I remember when we were gambling to win
Everybody else said ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?
Is it ever gonna be enough?

More and more
More and more
More and more
More and more and
More and more
More and more
More and more

Is it ever gonna be enough?
