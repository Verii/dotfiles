I tremble, they're gonna eat me alive
If I stumble they're gonna eat me alive
Can you hear my heart beating like a hammer?
Beating like a hammer

Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer
Hard to be soft, tough to be tender
Come take my pulse, the pace is on a runaway train
Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer, beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer

If we're still alive my regrets are few
If my life is mine what shouldn't I do?
I get wherever I'm going, I get whatever I need
While my blood's still flowing and my heart still beats
Beating like a hammer, beating like a hammer

Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer
Hard to be soft, tough to be tender
Come take my pulse, the pace is on a runaway train
Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer, beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer

If we're still alive my regrets are few
If my life is mine what shouldn't I do?
I get wherever I'm going, I get whatever I need

While my blood's still flowing and my heart still beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer, beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer

I tremble, they're gonna eat me alive
If I stumble they're gonna eat me alive
Can you hear my heart beating like a hammer?
Beating like a hammer, beating like a hammer
Beating like a hammer

Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer
