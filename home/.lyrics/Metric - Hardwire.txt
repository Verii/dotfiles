EMILY:
Giving for chances to
Leave the basement life
I'm not the landlord's wife
Furnished room
Celebrate the first flight window
Bird's eye view

You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar
Stay smoothly stoned
Past four in the morning 
Though we both see it coming
We don't run
Let the silence settle in our bones.

You are everything you are
Nothing at all
You are everything you are
Nothing at all
You are every night you fade 
To light you fade 
To light the room
Daylight writes a new light on you

Giving for chances to
Take it all in stride
Why'd we walk a broken line
Of minus signs

You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar
Stay smoothly stoned
Past four in the the morning
Though we both see it coming
We don't run
Let the silence settle in our bones

You are everything you are
Nothing at all
You are everything you are
Nothing at all
You are every night you fade
To light you fade
To light the room.
Daylight writes a new light on you

JIMMY:
You leave your eyes there for me to memorize
I can see you happy in the shadows I despise

EMILY:
You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar
You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar
You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar
You hardwire
I'll try to play the guitar
