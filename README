Each directory contains the files where symlinks will be created to

e.g. the home/ directory contains the configuration files that will be linked
from ${HOME}/. So home/.bash_history will have a symlink created in
/home/james/.bash_history to /home/james/projects/dotfiles/home/.bash_history

In this way all configuration can be managed in this git repo, while making it
easy to public new configuration files.
